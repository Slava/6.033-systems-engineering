# Security

Common security measurements:

- compartmentalize
- audit
- deterrence

Internet attacks are:

- fast
- cheap
- scalable


There are many ways to trick either a machine or a human being into giving up
some private data. When do we stop thinking about new ways to do that?

Security approach:

- Policy: secrecy, integrity (application specific)
- Threat model: assumptions


## Threat model

Conservative but reasonable threats:

- Adversary control one of the machines
- Adversary control software on others' computers
- Adversary knows about user passwords
- Adversary knows bugs in software

## Guard model

Complete mediation: there is no other way to access a resource rather than going
through a guard.

- Enforce client/server separation
- Invoking the guard on every operation

Typically the guard has two functions: authentication (who is requesting) and
authorization check (if this user/group can perform operation on this resource).

Software bugs lead to incomplete mediation and thus security holes.


### Principle of least privilege

The privilege code is the code that has a chance to run a guard or not, it is
better to put the guard on a different layer (like database) to minimize the
amount of privileged code. Less code => less bugs => less security holes.


### Policy vs Mechanisms

P: no student reads grades.txt
M: permissions on files
M: firewall rules
M: encryption


### What goes wrong

- Layer interactions (strong assumptions about naming indirection?)
- Users make mistakes
- Cost of security leads users to drop it or bypass it
