# Security

Common security measurements:

- compartmentalize
- audit
- deterrence

Internet attacks are:

- fast
- cheap
- scalable


There are many ways to trick either a machine or a human being into giving up
some private data. When do we stop thinking about new ways to do that?

Security approach:

- Policy: secrecy, integrity (application specific)
- Threat model: assumptions


## Threat model

Conservative but reasonable threats:

- Adversary control one of the machines
- Adversary control software on others' computers
- Adversary knows about user passwords
- Adversary knows bugs in software

## Guard model

Complete mediation: there is no other way to access a resource rather than going
through a guard.

- Enforce client/server separation
- Invoking the guard on every operation

Typically the guard has two functions: authentication (who is requesting) and
authorization check (if this user/group can perform operation on this resource).

Software bugs lead to incomplete mediation and thus security holes.


### Principle of least privilege

The privilege code is the code that has a chance to run a guard or not, it is
better to put the guard on a different layer (like database) to minimize the
amount of privileged code. Less code => less bugs => less security holes.


### Policy vs Mechanisms

P: no student reads grades.txt
M: permissions on files
M: firewall rules
M: encryption


### What goes wrong

- Layer interactions (strong assumptions about naming indirection?)
- Users make mistakes
- Cost of security leads users to drop it or bypass it



# Hands-on buffer overrun

Q1. First shellcode.S invokes sysall `unlink()` to delete the file. Then
`exit()` to exit the process.

Q2.
```
%EB%1B%5E%89v%0B1%C0%88F%0A%B8%0A%00%00%00%89%F3%CD%80%B8%01%00%00%001%DB%CD%80%E8%E0%FF%FF%FFgrades.txtxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx%DC%DC%FF%FF
```

The first part is the compiled `shellcode` contents. The character `v` is `0x76`
in Unicode. The `grades.txt` is the predefined string in `shellcode`.

The second part is a line of 'x's. It is a padding that could be filled with
anything. We put a certain number of padding so we get to the position of the
return pointer skipping the rest of local variables we don't care about.

The last part `%DC%DC%FF%FF` is the address of `reqpath` reversed byte-wise.
This is the point where we override the return pointer to the location of
`reqpath` buffer, where we placed the contents of `shellcode.S`.

Q3. The old exploit can't remove the file because the stack memory is not
executable anymore, no reference to execstack in the compilation line.

Q4. The return address now contains the address of the `unlink` function from
glibc. P contains the address of the filename we put right after.

Q5. Yes, the addresses change but the layout is the same (the distance between
reqpath and ebp);

Q6. On my machine the 'magic string' was `../../../../etc/passwd`. As served
files were not restricted by the use of `..` and such and the process wasn't
chroot'd, this was trivially easy.

(Fun fact: this exact vuln existed in an npm module called gzippo).


It doesn't work in the browser though. Probably because my browser implements
some basic guarding against such attacks.

Q7. I didn't do it but potentially we can find the address of `system()` and
call `sed -i 's/F/A' grades.txt`.

Q8. Didn't do
