# Transactions Concurrency

- all-or-nothing   <- atomicity
- before-or-after  <- isolation

We want to think of a transaction as of an atomic indivisible unit. And
transfer(A, B) and transfer(B, C) always run one before another so
programmer doesn't need to think of locking - serial order.

We can solve this problem with a big global lock. But we want to get some
concurrency with transactions (or better parallelism).

Set fine-grained locks based on transaction's read set and write set.

## Conflict serializable

    Look for every pair of transactions Ti, Tj
      For each pair of conflicting operations Tio, Tjo
        must be ordered in the same way in Ti and Tj

If there is no way two transactions can run concurrently, transaction
system should prevent the second transaction from running until first
transaction is ended or aborted.

## Locking protocol

Locking should happen inside the transaction system and shouldn't even be
visible to the database user. A simple protocol: acquire lock for object
every time there is a read or write for the variable.

When is the right time to release lock? When we commit.

Deadlocks? Yes, deadlocks can happen if two transactions lock the objects in a
different order: first one tries to acquire A and B, second tries to
acquire B and A.

One of the solutions is to agree on a lock ordering. The downside is - you
always need to know the set of lock to acquire before transaction.

Another solution is to abort a transaction in case of deadlock.

Deadlock detection:
Construct a wait dependency graph. If the dependency graph has a cycle, then
we have a deadlock.

Managing a dependency graph can be too much overhead, another solution is to
timeout a transaction (doesn't work with complex and big transactions).

## Optimizations

Have read/write locks. And if transactions read but don't write the same
object, allow them to run in parallel.

Release the read lock on object when it is read but is not used after that.
(Lock point, similar to commit point, defines the order). (2 phase locking)

We cannot release write locks early (right after the last write to object)
because we cannot release before the commit point (in case of abort, the
incorrect value can be read by other transaction). (Strict 2 phase locking)
