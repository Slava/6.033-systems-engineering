Reliability and congestion control
===

Network layer doesn't do much, guarantees are:

- variable delay
- variable rate
- packet loss
- duplicates
- reordering
- maximum length

### Reliability

"At least once" (take 1): lock-step

Acknowledge every packet delivery with a unique identifier (with a
timeout).

If timeout is too big, delays between packages are too long.
If timeout is too small, then we have unnecessary retransmissions.

The solution is to have timeouts depend on the variable round-trip-time.

Because of congestion of the link the RTT might vary a lot.

TCP recalculates it as Exponentially Weighted Moving Average;

In a lock-step protocol both sender and receiver are idle waiting for a
packet/ack. To get more throughput we can use a fixed window sending multiple
packets in a row.

"At Least Once": fixed window

- receiver tells the acceptable window size
- sender sends a window
- receiver acks each packet
- new window is sent on all acks

"At Least Once": Sliding window

- advance the window by one for each in-sequence ack it receives (pipelining idea)

If one of the packets get lost different implementations resend the lost
packet after the timeout, others resend the whole batch.

What is the correct size of the sliding window?

If the window is too small, we get a long idle time and unutilized time.

If the window is too large the network gets congested.

TCP uses acks to adopt to link capacity, rate at which server processes,
congestion, packet lost.
Has an explicit setup and tear-down.


### Congestion Control

Setting window size: flow control. Window <= Receiver Buffer.

Window <= capacity of link

Transmission Rate <= Bottleneck Capacity

Transmission Rate = Window / RTT

Window <= min(Receiver Buffer, Bottleneck_cap * RTT)


The congestion control becomes more difficult when there are multiple senders
and receivers using the same link.


Congestion Control Protocol adapts the congestion window (cwnd) to ensure
efficiency and fairness of use.

So Window <= min(Receiver Buffer, cwnd)

The basic idea:

- Start growing cwnd slowly; if no drops -> no congestion yet
- if a drop occurs -> decrease cwnd quickly

Australia and Japan are pretty far from here too.

Increasing the packet size didn't increase the average round-trip time
significantly. (Although it did increase a bit).

Q4.

For both www.wits.ac.za and www.microsoft.com didn't receive any ping response.
Although both sites work in browser. The reason is - they disable ICMP.

Q5. traceroute sends packets with different TTL values starting from 1 and
increasing it by 1 every time. Each packet gets dropped by a different route
further in chain and the router replies with ICMP Time Exceeded message.
traceroute uses this to build up the list of routers.

Q7.
Traces are different but similar in opposite directions. Probably because there
are a lot of different routes from one computer to another and different package
forwarding policies make the routing slightly different in different directions.
