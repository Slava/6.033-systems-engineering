# OS Threads

We need more concurrent processes than we have phisical CPUs. That's why OS
would virtualize a lot of CPUs.

Thread is an abstraction very similar and influenced by OS's virtual CPUs.

## Thread

- State: running program
- suspend()
- resume()

Now we can implement lock without busy looping. We can suspend our thread:

    yield - system call
      suspend current thread
      choose a new thread T to run
      resume T

`choose a new thred T to run` is random or round-robbin.

So to manage threads OS would need to keep information for every thread:
- state of thread (running/ready to run, what CPU, etc)
- state of the running program (stack pointer)


Also OS would keep track of CPUs states: what thread is running currently


In the implementation of yield we need to ensure we lock on setting thread
runnable or running and putting it on CPU. So we want to make sure thread
doesn't run on several CPUs.


## Condition variable

This is good, now if thread is waiting on free space in the buffer to put a
message it will not busy loop waisting CPU cycles but will occasionally wake up
(when some other thread yields to it) and check if there is a space for message
available in buffer.

It is less looping but still looping every time it awakes. We can make it so
thread will wake up only when there is something to do with the next abstraction
called conditional variable which has two methods:

    wait(cv, lock)
      release lock & sleep
      re-acquire lock

    notify(cv)
      wake up Threads sleeping on cv

CVs are stateless.

- We are waiting -> someone notifies us:
  * everything is good
- someone notifies us -> and we want to wake:
  * race condition happened, nobody notifies us anymore as we missed it

We use an additional lock to solve the missed wake problem. This is also very improtant release & wait are an atomic unit (as they acquire scheduler lock).

In out send and recieve implementation (put or take a message to or from buffer)
each thread waiting on free space in buffer will get notified and check if there
is space and wait on notification on negative. Still looping but less.

## Yield and wait

Very tricky.

## What if program doesn't want to yield

We implement *Preemption* using timer interrupt (on typical CPU is every 10ms).

Every several ms forces current thread to yields. We need to be careful to not
to force timer interrupt during program's yield. We need another hardware
feature to avoid yet another deadlock.
