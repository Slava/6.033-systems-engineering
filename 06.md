# Virtual Machines

What if Kernel itself has errors?

- Monolithic kernel (Linux)
  * no enforced modularity
  * bugs in kernel may be very dangerous
    => arbitrary failures
    => masked problems
- Microkernel
  * enforced modularity
  * but dependencies between components makes it hard to separate things

Trade-off: redesign MK vs new features

## Multiple OS on 1 computer

- Compatibility is a challenge, that's why the abstraction is difficult.
- So we go with Virtualization


Virtual machines (VM)

    [ls][vi][ps][ls]
    [kernel][kernel] - Guest
    [  VM monitor  ] - Host

VM state:

- memory
- PTP register (page table pointer)
- U/K bit

So VM monitor acts like a kernel and every guest kernel is similar to a thread...

Now we have two mappings:

Guest virtual mem. <=> Guest physical mem. <=> Host physical mem.
                   PTP                     PTP

There is a technique to combine those two mappings into one: Shadow page tables

In order to restrict the guest OS from modifying the real memory page containing
their PTP, host OS would mark that real page as read-only.

Virtualizing U/K bit:
- both guest kernel and guest program are now running in the real user mode
- U/K bit effects:
  * privileged instrc.
- trap instrc. and emulate them to the guest


Non-virtualizable instr:
- on x86 not every instruction was trapable
- ex: read cur U/K bit
- para-virtualization - tell guest OS not to execute those
  instructions directly (Xen did it)
  * not able to do it with Windows, no source code
- VMware did binary translation: replaces instruction in binary
- Hardware support
