Naming
======

Hard part in a system is to split pieces and define interfaces so it is easy to
reason about components and put them together.

There is no a single naming scheme fitting everything but there are common
patterns on a higher level.

Goals of naming system:

- provide a user-friendly identifier
- enable sharing
- retrieval
- indirection
- hiding (implementation details)

Name examples:
- register name, memory address
- IP address
- domain name (mit.edu)
- file system path
- URI
- email address
- ls (command name)
- etc

Abstract view:

Every naming system has a universal names set.
Also it has values.
And names are mapped to values via lookup function.
Often, lookup function also requires the context.

For naming system:
Name syntax?
Values?
Who supplies context?
Global vs local?

For lookup function:
Can one name refer to several values?
Can one name refer to one value?
Can several names refer to same value?
Value w/o a name? (absence of name can be used as a defensive mechanism)

*Naming systems are built in layers*

Case study: DNS

- data is distributed
- hierarchy
- each node delegates subset of information to child nodes
- no universal agreement on how to manage data. Ex: mit.edu asked .edu once and
  then managed its nodes itself.
- if we try to ping www (not a full domain) it can be resolved to www.mit.edu if
  you have /etc/resolv.conf, it is a context.

- global names.
- scalable performance
  * caching
  * delegation
- fault tolerant

Challenges of DNS:

- .com belongs to Verisign
- who decides what are root domains?
- load on root servers
  * big load for names those don't exist (a lot of clients don't know how to
    cache absence)
- DoS

Case study: Virtual memory

Recitation: FS naming


Assignment: hands on UNIX
=========================

Questions:

1. Output list of your processes sorted:
    ps -u `whoami` -oargs | sed 1d | sort
2. The number of words in the file /usr/share/dict/words (*) which do not contain any of the letters a, e, i, o, or u.
    cat /usr/share/dict/words | grep -v '.*[aeiou].*' | wc -l
3. A 5x6 matrix of entries of alternating 1's and 0's. (No idea how to do it with pipes)
    for((i=0;i<6;i++)); do for((j=0;j<5;j++)); do echo -n "$(( ($i + $j + 1 ) % 2 )) ";  done; echo "";  done
4.  A "long" listing of the smallest 5 files in the /etc directory whose name contains the string ".conf", sorted by increasing file size.
    ls -lSr /etc/*.conf
5. In /etc/ you would get "permissions denied". Because you need permissions to create a file in /etc but it is fine you are piping output in memory. Pipe is publisher-consumer type of thing: if consumer doesn't accept data, producer would stop. It doesn't depend on free disk space.
6. Running two commands asynchronously would result in achieving "yynn" output. The second command starts running w/o waiting for first to finish.
7. It would require to lseek first and then write?
8. moving to the same directory or moving to the parent
9. to explicitely point at the current directory
10. number of files went from 2 to 4, size went from 68 to 136 and the last modified date changed.
11. the link number changed again. Maybe on mac os x it is different. On UNIX the reason would be directory vs file
12. you need to maintain the path of source file; once you delete the source file, links become broken; operations on symbolic link are not exactly the same as on hard link
13. ???
14. for convinience
15. cd /mit/6.033/../NAME? I guess symbolic links work differently on OS X, because .. seems to work fine. UPDATE: it is a bash feature
16. ./ls was first in the path
17. it is stdout file descriptor!!
18. hour and half :(
