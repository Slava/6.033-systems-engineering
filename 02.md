Naming
======

Hard part in a system is to split pieces and define interfaces so it is easy to
reason about components and put them together.

There is no a single naming scheme fitting everything but there are common
patterns on a higher level.

Goals of naming system:

- provide a user-friendly identifier
- enable sharing
- retrieval
- indirection
- hiding (implementation details)

Name examples:
- register name, memory address
- IP address
- domain name (mit.edu)
- file system path
- URI
- email address
- ls (command name)
- etc

Abstract view:

Every naming system has a universal names set.
Also it has values.
And names are mapped to values via lookup function.
Often, lookup function also requires the context.

For naming system:
Name syntax?
Values?
Who supplies context?
Global vs local?

For lookup function:
Can one name refer to several values?
Can one name refer to one value?
Can several names refer to same value?
Value w/o a name? (absence of name can be used as a defensive mechanism)

*Naming systems are built in layers*

Case study: DNS

- data is distributed
- hierarchy
- each node delegates subset of information to child nodes
- no universal agreement on how to manage data. Ex: mit.edu asked .edu once and
  then managed its nodes itself.
- if we try to ping www (not a full domain) it can be resolved to www.mit.edu if
  you have /etc/resolv.conf, it is a context.

- global names.
- scalable performance
  * caching
  * delegation
- fault tolerant

Challenges of DNS:

- .com belongs to Verisign
- who decides what are root domains?
- load on root servers
  * big load for names those don't exist (a lot of clients don't know how to
    cache absence)
- DoS

Case study: Virtual memory

Recitation: FS naming
