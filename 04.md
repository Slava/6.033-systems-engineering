# Client/Server in one computer, atomicity

There is a ServerX and ClientX running on the same machine. They need to
communicate, pass messages to each other.

Operating system would create an abstraction for server and client running in
the user land by providing system-calls available to call in the kernel land.

One of the ways to do it is to have system calls send/recieve. Send would send a
message to a process (server/client) and receive is to get a message for the
current process.

OS would have some buffer limited in size in the shared memory. Essentially it
is a circular queue but in the lecture is called Bounded Buffer (bb).

If we had two CPUs, one running client, another running server, send and receive
could use busy looping to put or take a message from queue. There is also a big
importance of shared memory access order (don't override before you read, race
conditions).

Limitations:

- only one sender and one receiver
- separate CPUs for client and server (sender and receiver)
- mem. access order is very important

## Multiple senders

    A: send(m1)
    B: send(m2)

Desired result: both messages are in buffer, order doesn't matter.

Well, if we are not careful, we hit race conditions. We use the lock abstraction
to deal with it. Also atomicity is explained.

## Locking strategies

- Coarse-grained lock: lock before doing any job and releasing after done all
  job in the function.
  * likely correct
  * but unperformant
- Fine-grained locking: one lock for every piece of data
  * more concurrency
  * very tricky to get right
  * easy to get into deadlock
    + you need to consider the whole system (all global locks)
    + try to acquire locks always in the same order

## Implement acquire/release

We need some kind of atomic operation to check if lock is free and set it to 
"in use" (flip switch) or busy loop.

Every CPU has some flavor of instruction RSM.

RSM - read and set memory (swap). It is probably implemented in the hardware,
usually it is a piece of sillicon called bus arbitor, so we have a lock somewhere.
