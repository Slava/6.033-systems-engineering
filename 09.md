# Transport layers

Protocol:

- set of agreements to define the structure of conversation
- usually is a sequence of messages with its own header
- (DNS, TCP, UDP, IP are examples)

Layering of protocols:

Protocols stack on one another. Each adding/stripping off its own header or
splitting up higher-level data, multiplexes, etc.

It's a good design since layers can be independent from each other.

For some reason the International Committee decided to have 7 layers. But the
actual internet stack is usually 4 layers: link (WiFi/Fiber), network (IP),
transport (TCP/UDP) and app (HTTP/IMAP/SMTP).


Forwarding:

Each router has a forwarding table. Gets a packet, looks at the destination
header and forwards it on the correct link. If the destination is unknown,
packet is dropped. Decreases TTL, recomputes the checksum. If checksum of the
data doesn't match, packet is dropped.

The forwarding table is computed by forwarding protocol.

BGP is used to compute the forwarding table:

BGP is a path vector routing protocol.

- each node knows the path to itself in the beginning.
- each node advertises itself to the neighbors
- repeat: each node tells its neighbors its path to each other node

- drop advertisements if the path already has the current node to avoid
  loops
- pick the one path that is shorter
- continuously run this protocol and update the state to keep the info up to
  date; timeout information from neighbors

But this doesn't scale to big numbers so the Internet would run this
protocol inside each domain between inferior routers. So the address space is
hierarchical (domain and node id).

Advantages:

- scalable
- delegation

Disadvantages:

- sub-optimal paths
- mobility with the same address is difficult as the address space is
  hierarchical (your domain changes with your geolocation)
