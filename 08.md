Network Systems
===

Network is a system! Network consists of many networks, many links and many
switches.

Problems:

- Economical
  * Universality - should we have a separate network for every service or one
    big general-purpose network? The later.
  * What is the interface of the network? Is it a smart network that supports a
    bunch of operations on it or is it a dumb network and services build on top
    of it? (Internet is a dumb network)
  * If it is a dumb network, hosts should agree on the protocol: Protocol
    Standardization.
  * Topology: O(N^2) is very expensive. Popular solutions are hubs and meshes
    (multi-hubs).
  * Utilization: how much link do we buy? Max send rate? Too expensive. Average
    utilization is much smaller. Network providers are planning based on
    "Statistical multiplexing". It relies on the assumption that end hosts are
    independent and at any given point at time the combined send rate is not
    that high. (Which is wrong, for real people activities are connected to
    day/night cycle).
- Organizational
  * Routing: find a path from A to B. It turns out to be a global problem since
    one path in use can be blocking other transmissions those decided to go
    through this path. That's a hard problem.
  * Addressing: we could use flat ids, but there is no known way to scale it.
    Adressess in the Internet are structured by location: 22.94.0.11.
  * Sharing of nodes/links.
    + isochronous goes well with connection (phones work this way: you connect,
      the reciever can be busy)
    + asynchronous and connectionless (no reservations to talk, just send the
      packet) - packets are stuck in the queue (memory buffer) and once the
      packet goes out the information from headers is used (need enough
      information in headers to send packets this way and being able to put them
      together later)
  * How to deal with Overload:
    + Permanent: buy a new link
    + Medium time scale: push back clients
    + Short-term: buffer packets
    + (TCP drops packages)
- Physical
  * Errors
    + Link failure - coding fixes
    + Bad hosts - Cut the link
    + switch failures
    + operator failures
  * Speed of light (not very fast?)
  * Networks are heterogeneous


Internet is the best effort

No Guarantees:

- Variable Delay
- Variable rate
- Packet loss
- Duplicates
- Reordering

This design is somewhat successful since it gives a lot of flexibility to the
end hosts to deal with all of these.
