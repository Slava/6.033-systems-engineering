# Mobile code security

Goal: run arbitrary code, i.e. code that doesn't come with the OS packaging

Use case: Javascript on browser, Flash, mobile apps

Policy/goal:
- secrecy: user data is not disclosed
- integrity: user data is not corrputed

Thread model: malicious code


## Sandboxing via VMs per application

We can isolate applications completely with VMs running per application so if
the application is misbehaving, it will not harm other apps or the system.

It is great for isolation but not great for two reasons:
- VMs take up a lot of resources
- Interapp communication is very limited between VMs

Instead of isolating completely we need something called "controlled
sharing".

## Unix

Unix has a permission/ownership system for the FS where every user has an id,
every file has ACL based on the owner and permissions. Every process is
reprented by a file on FS as well. All files created by a process are owned by
the owner of the process.

Unix model is not a good fit because:
- it is focused on isolating actions of different users
- nothing is done to isolate applications ran by the same user


## Mobile apps

Mobile apps sandboxing is focusing more on apps and less on users (because
typically you have only one user and a lot of 3rd party code).

- Isolation: app-wise
- Objects: app-specific
- Operations: app-specific
- Authorization: defined by apps and approved by the user

## Android

Sharing:
- Interapp communication is expressed in "intends", each of them has a
target, action and data fields in a message and everything is
application-specific.
- There are different components in an application and intends are
  targetted on a specific component each time

Permissions:
- App defines permissions of sharing data it provides
- Components has labels
- Application defines a set of permissions it requires

Policy:
- server decides what parts of the application are worse protecting based on
  declared permissions
- client requests permissions
- user approves the list of required permissions required by the client (app)

Isolation enforcement:
- reference monitor intercepts all messages between apps and controls their
  permissions
- since Android runs on top of linux, it can assign different unix user ids to
  every app

Pitfalls:
- User must make right decisions accepting permissions by apps
- Bugs in trusted components: Linux Kernel, PM, privileged apps
