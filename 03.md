Lecture 3
=========

- Soft modularity
- Enforced modularity
- Client/Server design
  * Remote procedure calls
  * RPC != PC

- Obviously have a system of separated modules
  * Tools: procedures
  * We hide internals to limit the propagation of effects
  * If we take a popular implementation: execution stack there is a contract
  between a caller and callee:
   + caller sets stack
   + callee doesn't modify the arguments
   + callee returns
   + callee doesn't wedge caller's environment
- Do programming languages enforce these contracts? (C, C++, Python?)
  * NO, maybe a procedure never returns or eats up all the memory
- Client/Server design
  * Client makes a request [f, args]
  * server waits for a request, computes result
  * server responses
  * Separating program to two machines we actually enforce a large part of
    contract
- Controlled problems:
  * bugs in msgs (checks)
  * server doesn't response (timeout)
  * server response wrong answer (?)
- Examples
  * x-windows
  * Web
  * AFS
- Other usage
  * share data
  * remote access
  * trusted 3rd party

Cutting interfaces is THE challenge but it is not this lecture.

In implementation

Client has UI for procedure BID
Server has implementation for BID

UI calls client stub, which marshals the call with arguments and sends it to
server. Server's stub receives the request, unmarshals arguments, computes the
result and sends the response in the same manner.

You can generate stubs automatically.

It appears RPCs are similar to PCs but enforce the contract. But it is not the
case.

- Network is not reliable. If request message fails to deliver, it retries. Then
  response may fail to deliver, and client retries again. If there are
  side-effects of RPC, you need to be smarter.
- We might give each RPC a UID.
- But you might lose a table of UIDs and responses.

Sometimes the failure can end up with "I don't know what happened" rather than
"Yes, it succeeded" or "No, it failed". It might be fine in some cases.

There are sophisticated algorithms for replicated state machines to make sure
you always fail over correctly.
