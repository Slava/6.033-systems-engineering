# Operating systems

OS Goals:

- multiplexing (running multiple things in parallel)
- protection of one process from others
- some degree of processes cooperation
- portability regardless of hardware
- performance

Achieving these goals will conflict with each other. There are trade-offs.


Techniques in this course:

- virtualization (like virtual memory)
- abstraction (disk -> filesystem; display -> window abstraction)


## Virtualization

if you have a CPU connected to DRAM and CPU executes an operation "load data to
register R0 from address 0x2148" (LD R0 0x248) for some process, it might access
the memory of a different process. It is not the isolation we want.

That's why we have MMU - memory management unit which translates virtual address
space to a physical address space every time CPU reads/writes data from DRAM.

This is the way we maintain isolation and protection. And MMU doesn't map every
address to every address, it works on the page granularity (0x2148 => 0x4148).

The translation system also makes programs portable: they don't care to not
using someone's address space.

MMU stores its look-up table in DRAM as well and has a special register pointing
at the table (PUP). Also for every virtual page address some additional bits are
stored: like P (present?), R/W (writable?), U/S (user access? or system). Can
generate a page fault (error).

That's another naming system. We have names (Virtual addresses) and values
(Physical addresses and bits), look up function (MMU table) and context (current
process we are working with). And naming system benefits: hiding, sharing,
indirection.

On Linux you can look at MMU table at /proc/self. (WOW, linking makes sense now)


But who sets the permission bits and mappings for MMU?

There is a special register on CPU+MMU that specifies if current process is
running in kernel mode or user mode: U/K. User mode process can't modify
register pointing at mapping table (PUP) for MMU and U/K register.

U/K transitions:

- starts in K mode
- K->U: kernel can switch at any time to U
- U->K: interrupts (look up the table of allowed entry points)


## Abstractions

I/O system calls are the abstraction FS -> disk.

How did they implement this abstraction?

- Library? -> No, no protection
- "System call", examples: open -> interrupt 33
                           read -> interrupt 34



## How do we make sure Kernel doesn't screw up?

Instead of having monolithic kernel, have micro kernel. Just have most of the
functionality in kernel programs. And micro kernel is so small it is easy to
keep kernel correct. That's how they've done it in 80s.

But performance wasn't that great.

And it wasn't as useful to have very important pieces (like filesystem) crash
w/o screwing up other parts of kernel.


## Summary

There are two techniques: virtualization and providing and abstraction.

There are two separations:
- program vs program
- program vs kernel
