Introduction
============

(videos 1-2)

Big complex systems can meet different problems:

- emergent properties (Ethernet cable: to validate the lack of collisions each
  packet is at least 64 bytes, because of the transfer speed)
- propagation of effects (If you touch one part of the system, other parts can
  be affected)
- increment to scaling issues (things working in small often don't work in large)

Sources of complexity:

- Too many goals, too many requirements
- Interacting features (combining features may lead to complexity)
- Performance goals

One of the most important things is choosing right abstraction. There is a
concept of layering abstraction: an abstraction that provides same power as an
abstraction right under it but gives a better interface to work with (assembly
-> C).

There is no algorithm for the right modularity. No clear way to cut system into
pieces, that's why we learn about it :).

This class is more about reading and writing design papers, no coding. Will have
both old and new papers (Unix and Map-Reduce). Most of them are about good
design and all of them are considered well written papers.

Medical Devices: The Therac-25
------------------------------

[Medical Devices: The Therac-25](http://web.mit.edu/6.033/www/papers/therac.pdf)
illustrates a case when software mistakes brought to people being seriously
injured with death consequences.

To sum up:

- Software had bugs (various logical bugs, race conditions)
- Bad software design practices
- Little error handling code
- Little of defensive design (self checks, termination on errors)
- Overconfidence in software (investigation was focusing on hardware errors)
- Too much responsibility on software (no hardware safe limits)
- Confusing reliability with safety (software failed rare but could caused
  catastrophic results)
- Too much confidence in reused software
- Convinient user interface over safety

Answers to questions.

I. Getting started

1. IP address of thyme.lcs.mit.edu is 18.26.0.122
2. ???
3. Expiration time is 1800 secs.
4. ai:  128.52.32.80
   ai.: 209.59.119.34
5. (?) `+domain` sets the domain of search. Trailing dot in 'ai.' says it is
   the full domain name. 'ai' implies it is 'ai.mit.edu'.

II. Understanding hiearchy

6. `dig @i.root-servers.net. lirone.csail.mit.edu +norecurs`
7. `dig @f.edu-servers.net. lirone.csail.mit.edu +norecurs`
   `dig @usw2.akam.net. lirone.csail.mit.edu +norecurs`
   `dig @auth-ns0.csail.mit.edu. lirone.csail.mit.edu +norecurs`
   `18.26.1.36`

III. Understanding caching

8. `dig @k.root-servers.net. www.dmoz.org +norecur` - was in cache
9. ???
10. ???

Moore's law works.

Single microprocessor doesn't advance that fast anymore.

RAM access is a slowing factor, it is improving ~7% a year (processors' # of transistors is improving 70% a year).

The future is going to be in parallel computing which is painful, complex. (Races everywhere!).
