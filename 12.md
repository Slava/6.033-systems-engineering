# Extending Client/Server handling failures

## Failures:

- software
- machine
- design
- operational
- enviromental (earthquakes, tsumanimis, etc)

Fault-tolerant systems: Reliable systems out of unreliable components.


## Approach:

- identify all possible faults
- detect and isolate
- handling the failures:
 * either fail-fast;
 * or fail-stop;
 * or mask;

Use persistent storage to save the permanent state between failures.


## Metric:

Availability = (mean time to failure) / (mean time to failure + mean time to repair)

Example:

How to calculate the availability of a hard drive disk.
Run 1K disks for 3K hours. After 10 failures -> 1/300K.
MTTF: 1/failure rate


### How to prevent errors in software?

- must be written with great care
 * stringent development practices
 * well-defined specs
 * modeling, simulations, verifications, etc
 * write several versions of the same softare
- minimizing the core (that should always stay stable)
