# Fault-tolerance

Goal: build a reliable system out of unreliable components.

We have mechanisms to recover from failure: log, shadow copy, etc.

But we also want to tolerate failures and still be able to respond w/o going
offline: replication. (e.g. RAID, DNS, data replication in DBs)


## File storage

If clients ask server to get files, server becomes a single point of failure. We
can replicate data on clients, so each client would have a local copy.

The problem here is how to keep all copies in sync with each other: consistency
is the challenge of the system.


### Pessimistic consistency

One of the ways is to assure the consistency immediately. i.e. avoid
inconsistencies. e.g.: don't update the copy until
everyone agrees on the change. This approach has a lot of disadvantages, it
reduces our availability and performance.

(discussed later)

### Optimistic consistency

Tolerate inconsistencies and then fix them later. Weaker consistency guarantees.

How do we resolve inconsistencies?

A naive approach: keep versioning every piece of data with time stamps. When data
is requested, each copy's time stamp is compared and the latest updated copy is
returned. Here the challenge is to keep the time in sync on different servers.

### Time

A single computer:

Interval is calculated by oscillator + counter.
Calendar time is a number from seconds since epoch.
When the machine is offline, there is small clock with a battery that keeps
counting.

Time synching:

- need to get the offset right for the accuracy
- need to know the frequency of each oscillator for precision

The network and processing latency doesn't allow clients just to ask for the
current time from the server.

We can estimate the network latency by keeping track of the start time stamp of
request and the end time stamp. Divide the difference by two: we get an
estimate. Then we know how to calculate the offset from the server.

This approach is not super accurate, when we have asymmetric latencies or there
are preemptions or other delays on the host, or network congestion (environment
is better before or after request or in different directions).

NTP is trying to do this but several times for a better estimate.


Another problem, setting the clock the time can become confusing the
applications, so the important rule is to "never set the time backward".

Time slewing: For situations when you need to adjust the clock from future
backwards we can slow-down our clock. We can also speed-up oscillator to get the
opposite effect.  Usually the oscillator is a piece of hardware that is not easy
to set. So instead we can set the estimated frequency of oscillator (and there
is an OS interrupt to notice this).

Now we know how to fix the offset (accuracy), how do we adjust the precision:
oscillator's estimated frequency? We do the same thing, we adjust local
frequency by checking with the server.


## Concurrent changes

Now we have synced time, we can use timestamps to replicate data and understand
what changes are more recent: client updates local copy and sets the TS to T,
and then send the update with T to replicas.

There is a problem with concurrent updates: time stamps alone are not sufficient
to detect concurrent updates and not even resolving conflicts.

We can introduce one more time stamp: last reconciled time stamp TR. So now
updates send both T and TR. To detect conflicts: if T1-TR1 and T2-TR2 overlap,
then there was a conflict.

- optimistic concurrency trade-off
- merge concurrent updates
- worst case: ask the user to resolve conflicts

There is no a general rule how to merge conflicts. (Remember how text-editor OT
is different from drag-n-drop list OT?)


## Multiple writers

If there are multiple replicas and multiple concurrent writers, the updates can
come to different replicas in different orders and results may differ. Time
stamps alone are not enough to keep track of everything.

We don't want to lose any updates. v2 replaces v1 only if v2 contains all
changes in v1.

Version vectors or vector time stamp: instead of having 1 time stamp of latest
local update, we keep a vector of time stamps from every server:
[t1, t2, t3, ...]. Now we can compare vectors.
