# Transactions

Transactions are interesting because they provide atomicity for operations.

For reliable systems we need to know how to recover after a failure.
Proactive techniques for availability are not enough and we need some
retroactive techniques.

There are a lot of concurrent operations going on and they have some
arbitrary ordering (similar to the challenge locks help us with in
in-memory operations). After a failure we need to reconstruct the events
correctly.

Both concurrency challenges and failures can be addressed with transactions.

The goal is to make a piece of code (list of operations) on data atomic so it
is all in one. Either all succeeds or fails with persistence on disk.

- before or after
- all or nothing

An example is: transfer money from A to B in the same bank. And audit the
amount of money across accounts.

To make a piece of code atomic we need to give up something. So we require an
explicit begin of transaction from the programmer, finished with commit or
abort. Unlike lock/unlock, transactions compose much better.


A naive implementation that would load all the data from disk, transfer
numbers from A to B and then write everything back to disk would not be
atomic as writing a file to disk is not atomic at all.

And it violates the golden rule of reliability: "Never overwrite the only
copy".

## Shadow copy

We would write the new copy to a new file. And then after we are sure,
write succeeded, we would rename the new file to the original name. And if the
rename is atomic, this should work better. We get "all or nothing"
atomicity and "before or after" atomicity.

In this case "rename" is the "commit point".

## Commit point

Let's look closer to "rename" as we rely on its atomicity. Actually the file
system does something clever. Naively we would unlink the old file, link the
new file with the new name and then unlink the new file's old name.

The insight is to look at the fs data-structures and realize that we don't want
to decrease the refcount (allowing fs to delete the file) of the inode
corresponding to the old file before rename is done.

    rename(x, y)
      ni = lookup(x)
      oi = lookup(y)
      incref(ni)
      y -> ni   # commit point
      decref(oi)
      * remove x
      decref(ni)

What if we fail after we commit but before we clean up the ref count? Part of
the recovery is to clean up and fix the fs.

All text editors implement atomicity the same way: when you are using emacs you
are editing the shadow copy and when you save (with C-x C-s, oh god),
rename happens.

## Limitations of this design

- it operates on the single file
- rewrites the whole file (inefficient)
- one in a time (doesn't allow concurrent operations)
- single machine only
